### The Problem 
Galasa started life as JAT (Java Automation Tool) - an internal IBM tool which was (and still is) extensively used for regression testing within IBM z/OS teams. It was created to help eliminate repetitive manual testing and checking from the CICS test team's workload every time a change was delivered. These tests could be complex and take a long time to set up and run, increasing the risk of introducing human-error into the process. It was also difficult to identify the cause of failures, as diagnostics were stored in different repositories. Application changes could take many months to reach production as it wasn't possible to accelerate the development cycle without a loss of confidence in the quality of the deliverable.

### The Solution
<p>To solve these problems, JAT was created. JAT was inspired by JUnit but with a focus on functional and integration testing, rather than unit testing. JAT is written in Java - in part because of Java's run-anywhere capability, huge number of utility libraries and its extensive ecosystem. However, the team found that Java expertise is not required to use it. Some knowledge of Java syntax proved useful, but the Java used to write tests is procedural rather than object-oriented, making scripting easier. The provided samples and examples were  utilised to further reduce any language barrier to entry.</p> 
<p>All aspects of a test run were automatically recorded in a single repository, so if a test failed at 2am it was easy to access logs, screenshots and data to help diagnose the cause of a failure quickly. The system proved highly scalable - capable of running hundreds of tests in parallel on automation servers - with the primary purpose of regression testing.</p> 

### The Result
After JAT was rolled out across CICS, the team automated their key manual tests, including running batch jobs, and provisioning and de-provisioning test environments. They found they were able to work much more efficiently, focusing on complex, edge test cases to root out critical defects, adapting quickly to testing new changes and features. Scalable and reliable regression tests running as part of the DevOps pipeline reduced the development lifecycle from 24 to 3 months without any loss of confidence in quality. In fact, JAT was so successful, that it was adopted by other teams within IBM, including Db2.

### The Future
IBM are now releasing an open-source version of JAT - called Galasa - so that others can benefit from this tooling. Weâ€™d love you to get involved with the project, and help us establish a collaborative community where we can share great ideas and build new, cool Galasa features together.
