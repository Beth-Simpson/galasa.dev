<p>Once you know which tests or parts of a test you want to automate, you can select the manager(s) you need. A table with the ![manager’s 
that are available with the current release is here](../reference/managers/Reference---Managers.md). For example, if you want to automate a test to run a batch job by using JCL, you need 
to call the z/OS Batch Manager from within your test code. </p> 

<p>Here’s an example of a manual test written in COBOL that’s been converted into an automated Cirillo test written in Java. You can find 
lots more sample tests that you can use to get you up and running ![here](../page_under_contrustion.md).</p>
