## What is DevOps?
DevOps is a set of processes that enable development and operations teams to work together to deliver and run software in a repeatable, fast and error-free way. 

## Benefits of Galasa as part of a DevOps strategy 
Galasa as part of a DevOps strategy can provide significant benefit in three key areas:

1.	<b>Faster time to value</b>

    Galasa provides the ability to automate integration tests in a repeatable and reliable way, enabling fast and efficient software delivery.

2.	<b>Increased capacity to innovate</b>

    Running your integration tests by using Galasa automation instead of running them manually saves time, freeing up people to work on higher-value activities.

3.	<b>Enhanced customer experience</b>
    
    Galasa enables continuous testing, so you can get early feedback from stakeholders about the software that’s being delivered.


## DevOps principles and Galasa
Galasa supports the following three key principles of DevOps:

 - <b>Develop and test against production-like systems</b>
    
    Galasa supports the DevOps concept "shift left", in which operational concerns move earlier in the delivery life cycle, toward development. Galasa enables teams to test against systems that behave like the production system, so that they can see how the application behaves and performs well before it’s ready for deployment.

    From an operations perspective this capability has tremendous value. It enables the operations team to see early in the cycle how their environment will behave when it supports the application, thereby allowing them to create a fine-tuned, application-aware environment.

 - <b>Deploy with repeatable, reliable processes</b>
 
    Galasa enables development and operations to support an agile software development process all the way through from development to production by using automation to run tests that are iterative, frequent, repeatable, and reliable.
    
    Frequent deployments and early testing allow teams to test the deployment processes themselves, thereby lowering the risk of deployment failures at release time.

 - <b>Monitor and validate operational quality</b>

    When software is tested, Galasa stores the test artifacts in a single repository, making it quicker and easier to analyse and identify the cause of a failure. Test results are captured in a consistent format, making sign-off between test environments simple and consistent.
