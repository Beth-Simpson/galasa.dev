### Lighten the load with automation 
Let Cirillo take care of repetitive, time-consuming manual regression tests, so you can focus on designing more complex test cases to root out critical application defects.

### Integrate across systems 
Cirillo integrates easily into your [delivery pipeline](https://github.ibm.com/eJATv3/docs/wiki/Cirillo-as-part-of-a-DevOps-strategy) and can be used alongside other test tools, such as JMeter and WSIM. Cirillo can access z/OS files and commands, and comes with built-in support for integration with other z/OS subsystems.

### Get the test data you need, fast
Cirillo can provision the test data that you need or can find data that matches your requirements from an existing data pool, removing the need to manually create or locate valid test data each time a test is run. Tests are isolated from changes in test data, making it easy to repeat tests for swift debugging.

### Fly through test cases
Run large numbers of tests across different environments in parallel by using automation. Test output is automatically recorded and stored in a single repository, making it easier to quickly identify the cause of a failure. 

### Deliver with confidence
Run reliable, repeatable, automated test suites to help you deliver changes quickly and with confidence. You can even build a test catalog dynamically from your test code and automatically select relevant regression test cases for a specific change set. 

### Environmentally friendly
Run the same test in different test environments without needing to change a single line of code. Speed up problem determination by running the test code locally on your laptop in debug mode or run a test suite overnight using automation. You can choose to use an existing z/OS environment, or get an environment provisioned specifically for you.
