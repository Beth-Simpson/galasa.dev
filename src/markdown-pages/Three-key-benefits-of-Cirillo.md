Testing is hard work – Cirillo reduces the amount of time a tester spends on the mundane, repetitive aspects of manual testing, freeing them up to put their knowledge and experience to work on locating those “hard-to-find” types of bugs.

Cirillo integrates into a _[DevOps pipeline](/learn/devops)_ and supports a “shift left” testing approach – reliable and repeatable tests can be run throughout the development lifecycle resulting in the ability to deploy changes more quickly without losing confidence in the quality of the code.

Tests are only as good as the data they are using. Cirillo can automatically provision valid test data for your test or can locate valid test data from an existing data pool. Cirillo stores all aspects of the test run in a single repository, making it easier to quickly diagnose the cause of a failure. 

Cirillo is open-source, so *download* it for free and start playing! There's a quickstart guide and lots of tutorials available to get you up and running quickly. 

Cirillo is currently available on z/OS platforms, but may be extended to other platforms in *future* releases.
