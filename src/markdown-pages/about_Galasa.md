Test automation is key to delivering changes to your core applications quickly and successfully, helping you to delight your customers, fast.

Galasa is an automated test tool, developed and used within IBM, now freely available as an open-source product. Start using Galasa to:

## Get agile
Deliver application changes to market faster, without losing confidence in quality. Galasa tests are not limited to testing mainframe-specific applications, so can be used to consolidate all application-based integration testing.

## Test smarter
Running and re-running manual tests is laborious, time consuming and not exactly the best use of a tester's skills or time. Use Galasa to run the repetitive tests and free up testers to spend their time designing test cases that are more likely to find important defects.

## Be consistent
Tests can be created by integrating multiple tools together, allowing you to share data between tools within the same test. You can store related tests within a test catalog, from which tests can be automatically selected to run for any given change set.

## Avoid conflict
Minimize conflict between teams for test environments. A scalable test runner means multiple tests can be run in parallel without the need for individual virtual machines for each test instance.

## Get valid data
Provision your own test data from scratch or find valid test data within an existing data lake. Test data is locked within the Galasa framework whilst in use, so that it cannot be corrupted by other test runs

## Diagnose fast
Run tests locally with breakpoints, so you can step through each line of test code and examine the content of variables to find bugs fast. Test artifacts from automated test runs are stored in a shared central respository, making debugging easy.

## Simplify
Make tests quicker to write and easier to maintain by moving boilerplate code out of test cases and into Managers. Simply call the Managers you need within your test code to access the methods and functions that each Manager provides during the test run.

## Communicate consistently
Galasa's dashboard integrates all your test results in one place, making reporting, reviewing, and sign-off between test phases easy and consistent.
