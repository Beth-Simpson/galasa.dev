Galasa is an automated test tool that was developed within IBM at the request of the IBM CICS test team. It was so successful, IBM decided to make it freely available as an open-source product. 

Automated testing is key to delivering change in an Agile way. Without test automation, it is very difficult to deliver changes quickly and successfully, 
helping you to delight your customers, fast. Start using Galasa to:

<p><b>Get agile</b></p>
<p>Deliver application changes to market faster, without losing confidence in quality. Galasa tests are not limited to testing mainframe-specific 
applications, so can be used to consolidate all application-based integration testing.</p>
<p><b>Test smarter</b></p> 
<p>Running and re-running manual tests is laborious, time consuming and (let's be honest) not exactly the best use of a tester's skills. 
Use Galasa to run the repetitive tests and free up testers to spend their time designing test cases that are more likely to find good defects.</p> 
<p><b>Be consistent</b></p> 
<p>Tests using multiple tools are integrated together in one place, giving a single test case catalog from which you can automatically select the best tests to run for a given change set.</p>
<p><b>Avoid conflict</b></p> 
<p>Minimize conflicts between teams for test environments and test slots. A scalable test runner allows for multiple tests to be run in parallel without the need for individual virtual machines for each test instance. Provision your own environment and data, or connect to an existing environment or data pool which is automatically cleaned up when the test completes.</p>
<p><b>Get valid data</b></p>
<p>Test data can be shared, locked either within the Galasa framework or alongside a data tool.</p>
<p><b>Diagnose fast</b></p> 
<p>Tests can be run locally under control of the java debug tool allowing for lines of code in a test to be stepped over, local variables examined and the remote system logged onto in parallel. Galasa automatically collects all diagnostics from a test run and stores the output in a single respository. Storing all test artifacts in a shared central repository makes forÂ easier debugging. </p>
<p><b>Simplify</b></p> 
<p>Galasa's dashboard integrates all your test results in one place, making reports, review, and sign-off between test phases easy and consistent.</p>
