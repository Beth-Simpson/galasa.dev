Test automation is key to delivering changes quickly and successfully, helping you to delight your customers, fast.

Galasa is an automated test tool developed within IBM at the request of the IBM CICS test team. It was so successful, IBM decided to make it freely available as an open-source product. You can now start using Galasa to:

<p><b>Get agile</b></p>
<p>Deliver application changes to market faster, without losing confidence in quality. Galasa tests are not limited to testing mainframe-specific applications, so can be used to consolidate all application-based integration testing.</p>
<p><b>Test smarter</b></p> 
<p>Running and re-running manual tests is laborious, time consuming and (let's be honest) not exactly the best use of a tester's skills. 
Use Galasa to run the repetitive tests and free up testers to spend their time designing test cases that are more likely to find good defects.</p> 
<p><b>Be consistent</b></p> 
<p>Tests using multiple tools are integrated together in one place, creating a single test case catalog from which tests can be automatically selected to run for any given change set.</p>
<p><b>Avoid conflict</b></p> 
<p>Minimize conflicts between teams for test environments and test slots. A scalable test runner allows for multiple tests to be run in parallel without the need for individual virtual machines for each test instance. Provision your own environment and data, or connect to an existing environment or data pool which is automatically cleaned up when the test completes.</p>
<p><b>Get valid data</b></p>
<p>Provision your own test data or find valid test data within an existing data pool. Test data can be shared - locked either within the Galasa framework or alongside a data tool.</p>
<p><b>Diagnose fast</b></p> 
<p>Run tests locally under the control of the Java debug tool so you can step through lines of test code and examine the content of variables to find bugs fast. All test artifacts from automated test runs are stored in a shared central respository, making debugging easy. </p>
<p><b>Simplify</b></p> 
<p>Galasa's dashboard integrates all your test results in one place, making reporting, reviewing, and sign-off between test phases easy and consistent.</p>
