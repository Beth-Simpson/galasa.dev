title: Galasa benefits
---

80% of all enterprise testing is manual. Imagine how much faster you could deploy applications if you could automate a significant proportion of this. 

Automated testing and agile delivery are traditionally seen as being available only in greenfield projects, but with the introduction of Galasa, you can be agile in a mainframe environment as well. 

## Why automate with Galasa?
- A great fit for automating a wide set of test techniques including golden path, variation and load tests. However, its biggest benefit is that it can be used to create integration level tests.
- Enables you to run tests across a hybrid cloud application from a single test class. 
- Provides the capability to test a range of interfaces from traditional 3270 terminals through to REST, mobile and browser-based tests.  
- Enables unique, deep integration with z/OS and extends to other test tools, enabling tests to aggregate information from a range of sources.

## Testing without limitations
Testing an endpoint, whether it be a 3270 terminal, a REST API or a web service is a simple operation and there are plenty of tools 
that enable you to accomplish this task.  However, there are  limitations to some of these tools:

-	The tests cannot utilize a mix of technologies.  For example, letâ€™s say you need to examine an IBM CICS or a z/OS resource to validate that the response from the REST endpoint you are testing is correct.  How can the test get this information without the tester understanding how to access it?
-	Most of the tools require some level of manual operation which limits their effectiveness in a continuous delivery pipeline
-	The tools cannot contextually bind to either a provisioned, or pre-existing environment in an intelligent manner.

Galasa makes it simple for a test to access, drive and interrogate a range of z/OS, distributed and open source tools and integrate them together within the same simple test class.

Tests written for Galasa can be run locally on your computer for manual debugging or can be scheduled to run on a server in automation mode - great for overnight runs or when you need to run tests in parallel or at scale.
